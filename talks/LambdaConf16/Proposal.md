# Hubris: Programming, Verification, and Optimization

This talk will demonstrate Hubris: a brand new dependently typed language. 
The language is intended to be a tool for teaching, research, and 
experimentation. The primary goals are to use modern tools and approaches 
to implement a fast type checker, optimizing compiler, and better tooling, 
such as formatting, build tools, and more. Of course Hubris is a work in 
progress and this talk will be first time public talk about it. We will
focus on the process of writing a dependently typed language isn't as 
scary as it sounds while encouraging  more experimentation in pragmatic 
depdently typed programming languages.
