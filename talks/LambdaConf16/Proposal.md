# Hubris: Programming, Verification, and Optimization

This talk will demonstrate Hubris, a brand new dependently typed programming language.
Among Hubris' goals is to be a modern testbed for teaching, research, and experimentation
with dependent type checking. It focuses on applying modern tools and approaches to implement a
fast type checker, optimizing compiler, and modern language necessities
such as a formatting tool, editor support, a build tool, and more. This first public talk on Hubris
will examine the process of writing a dependently
typed language, the language's current state, and future work.
Attendees will walk away feeling ready to pursue experimentation in
pragmatic dependently typed programming languages.
