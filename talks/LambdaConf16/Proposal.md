# Hubris: Programming, Verification, and Optimization

This talk will demonstrate Hubris: a brand new dependently typed language. 
The language is intended to be a tool for teaching, research, and 
experimentation. The primary goal was to build a usuable programming
language first, and a dependent type checker second. A secondary
focus is applying modern tools and approaches to implement a 
fast type checker, optimizing compiler, and modern language necessities
such as a formatting tool, editor support, a build tool, and more. 
Of course Hubris is a work in  progress and this will be the first public 
talk about it. The talk will examine the process of writing a dependently 
typed language, the languages current state, and future work. Ideally
attendees will walk away feeling ready to pursue experimentation in 
pragmatic depdently typed programming languages.
