# The Hubris Programming Language

Hubris is a brand new dependently typed programming language designed for experimentation and research.

It is still very much a work in progress and there is much to do.

## Development

Currently development of Hubris is on Rust Nightly. For instructions on how to install it go [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/downloads.html). You can also try Brian's great [multirust](https://github.com/brson/multirust) which is my reconmended way of installing Rust.

If you have `multirust` you can swich to the appropriate version like so:
```multirust override nightly```

You can build Hubris with `cargo` using the standard commands, `build`, `test`, etc.
